This application was primarily designed to run on Intermec hand-held computers for the purpose of eliminating the use of paper to keep the score. It allows for 3 types of spades game play, 3 and 4 handed single player and 4 handed with 2 teams. The apps keeps track of all bids and tricks taken by the players and is dumped into a CSV file when it is exited. There is an ability to skin (change the color) the buttons and lettering. It also allows for the editing of any round at any time in case an error was made with a recalculation of the score after the change is commited. This application is written using Java AWT (no swing) due to the limitations of the Java runtime installed on the devices.
